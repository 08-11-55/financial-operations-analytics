## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the complete workflow of financial analytics for an organization:

- Analyze financial KPIs to understand business health  
- Explore revenue streams and cost centers  
- Identify trends and anomalies in financial data  
- Generate actionable insights and reports  
- Use Python and SQL to automate analysis

## Folder Structure

- `data/` : Contains **raw** and **processed datasets** (CSV/Excel files)  
- `notebooks/` : Jupyter notebooks for **data exploration, visualization, and experimentation**  
- `src/` : Production-ready Python scripts for **cleaned analysis and automation**  

---

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed (>=3.8)  
2. Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sqlalchemy

python src/financial_analytics.py

Libraries Used

pandas → Data manipulation

numpy → Numerical operations

matplotlib / seaborn → Visualizations

database connector → SQL data extraction

Key Features

Automated KPI calculation and reporting

Revenue and cost trend analysis

Dashboard-ready visualizations

Modular code for reusability

Future Improvements

Integrate Power BI / Tableau dashboards

Add predictive analytics for forecasting

Automate data extraction from live SQL databases

---

This is **full and recruiter-friendly**. Once you paste it into your README.md and commit, your GitHub repo will look like a **professional, end-to-end project**.  

If you want, I can also **create a starter `financial_analytics.py` file** for `src/` with basic structure so your repo is completely ready to run.  

Do you want me to do that next?
